# TheMovieDB_App_MVVM_kotlin
This is a sample app using themoviedb.org api to understand the MVVM pattern using Kotlin.

Refractored MVVM code to remove the Repo dependency from view and api service from VM

ALthough this is breaking the Single responsibility principle by making the dependency itself. It will be solved by using DI (Dagger 2) in future branches
